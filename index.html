<h1>Personal Information</h1>

<p>
My name is Pham Tran Trung Hieu (S3836565). 
</p>
<p>
I'm 20 years old. I'm originally from Vung Tau. I moved to Ho Chi Minh over 14 years ago as a student in Vietnam Australia school with my big sister. However, later in college, I transferred to Saigon International School and moved out alone since my sister went to Canada. I'm a friendly person who enjoys working in the field related to computers and technology. I'm interested in many things, such as video games and hi-tech equipment—my other hobbies, including hanging with my friends.

What is your interest in IT?
</h1>
<p>
My interest in IT appears back when I was a primary student. It was the first time I have a chance to use a computer. My friend shows my many game websites like gamevui, y8 I spent countless hours on them to play web game age of war, happy farm, gunny most of them are single play game it fun but end fast, and don't have much graphic back then. Later on, I found that online web games that can connect people playing games together have a unique feature that shows people the achievement and the stage of the game that we currently play. Is was terrific the first time I found it since people can brag about how strong their character or how precious their asset was in the game.
Furthermore, the explosion of online games, most of the hot game titles in that time required to download and install the game, is what we call "PC games" nowadays. These games allow players to compete online continuously. For instance, some popular titles that can be mentioned are zing speed, boom online, crossfire, and silk road. It is not like these game genres are new because most of them are developed from older games; for example, boom online is similar to Dyna Blaster, Crossfire is similar with counter stickers 1.6, which was the king back then but the reason why they are so popular is that they allow people to compete online together which was huge back then. I was amazed by the game industry to develop through time and how the technology keeps up with it; that is why I am so interested in IT
</p>
<p>
Moreover, computer games now require a lot of hardware power and sometimes technical skills to smoothly experienced the game. That is why I have to equipped to myself some hardware and software knowledge from different sources in other to have decent computer knowledge to buy and build a computer that runs games that I like and prevent myself from tricked by salespeople. In addition, i join CSC and AIT in my college year as two main subjects. Even though i did not receive high results at the end, but it has given me a lot of experience and knowledge in the technology field.
</p>
<p>
I choose RMIT school because it is the only English language and Technology school that my family and I believe in. This is due to my high school was in Australia System so Vietnamese can only be a minor subject. This lead to Vietnamese college does not allow me to enter their school. Also, not to mention that I cancel my Canada since the climate is rigorous. So RMIT is my only choice.
</p>
<p>
What is expected from this course is that is will be given a decent amount of knowledge in Information technology knowledge that helps me later on in life or when I am working. Furthermore, I will tell you more about the ideal job
</p>
<h1>
Ideal Job
</h1>
<p>
The Ideas Job that I want to talk about is Game Associate Producer. Game Associate Producer basically means to control the workflow of everyone from every aspect in the studio, especially game production staff, to ensure everyone is doing what they're doing what they supposed to be doing. Associate Producer role is varied depending on the stage of the game projects. Usually, they have to decide the filing and archiving games assets, such as artwork, videos, and photos for marketing and press releases. They responsible for balance time, money, and quality. One of their primary job of the producer is the ability to manage people through communication and conflict in the project. Sometimes they may be involved in creative decisions for the game. However, their main focus is on facilitating the development process.
From the description above shows that the qualifications for the jobs are a Bachelor's degree or higher (Oversea education or experience is a big plus). Over five years of experience in game/internet product management. Able to solve problems across a broad spectrum, from operational, technical, legal to team management issues. In addition, the summary of all necessary skills is strong leadership, project management, and effective communication and organization. This position appeals to me because it suits my interest in working as a leader and caring for the team, especially in game projects.
</p>
<p>
About the plan, how I will obtain the skills, qualifications, and experience required for the position. First, it is to finish the RMIT course accompanied by that are some further extending courses in a different field. ​Besides that, I'm planning to get a second bachelor's degree after this IT course, especially in managing field. In addition, in other to have the experience time required for the position, after university completion, I would apply for the VNG or other company fresher program. I might not have the ideal job in the early years, but I will try to work my way to my perfect job.
</p>
<p>
After I finished the test, the result is kind of vague to me. However, I do keep in all the suggestions and advice that the website is given. I believe that these results may not influence my behavior in my team since it might not represent who I am, furthermore, about how I would take into account when forming a team with their results. In my opinion, I believe that evaluating someone by some of their online test results is kind of unfair.
</p>

Project Ideas
</h1>
<p>
This essay's project ideas are developing a helpful tool for a game title called Escape From Tarkov. Escape From Tarkov is a hardcore and realistic online first-person action RPG/Simulator with MMO features. What is meant is that the game is tough to understand when items you bring to the match can be loose if you are killed in action, and if you escape from the map without dying, the thing you have looted from the boodies has killed or from monuments in the map will belong to you. The tool that I want to make would help the players in different game stages, especially in identity items prices, map orientation, gun modding, trader guide, and questline.
</p>
<p>
The interesting point of this project is that although the game always maintains top 10 categories, sometimes 5, ( especially in the early of the wipe days ) of live viewers in Twitch, there are no good applications or websites with a decent guide for newbie players this lead to a massive need of demand but no supplier. As this opportunity, if we can create a product that satisfies the players, we could reach a large number of users for the application. Besides, if the product results successfully, we could gain a considerable profit from it.
</p>
First and foremost, some of the features of the application/website that i believe that is must-have in other for the projects to be successful are item prices, map orientation, gun modding, trader guide, and questline. What I mean by item prices is that. In "EFT", there are about 1700-2000 items with a different value ( sale prices ), what does the used for and does it require for any quest of the game. This is really hard to keep track even with some veteran players with years of experience. As a result, having a tool to identify these items and have a description for each of them would be huge for any players. The second feature that I believe that our product must-have is modding a gun. In "EFT," modding guns require a lot of know leading from understanding since there are about 70 guns ( before the August update ). With many attachments range from the magazine's size from each weapon, pistol grip for each type of guns, stock, gas mod, dust cover, muzzle, optic, sight, and charge we could create a primary gun modding guide for newbie player in other to give the best option in the budget. 
Secondly, about the map and loot, EFT is kind of a unique game where there is no navigation where the character is standing the map, players have to remember the map itself in other to navigate the escape points. This result in having a feature in the app where it provides some pictures of each map's unique spot in other for the newbie to locate themselves is needed. Furthermore, we could identify some of the excellent loot spots on the map where there is more chance of spawning useful items. Also, on that map we could draw out the escape spot for each player since the game doesn't navigate itself for the players. 
Lastly are trader, barter trade and questline because of the vast amount of items keeping track of the prices of each item is painful and a lot of time you do not know which item is worth more to pick up having a description display it value would help the players profit more from each raid. Furthermore, with the items barter trade and questline, most of the quests do not have exact guidelines for the task players have to rely on youtube guidelines in other to finish the task. This leads to the problems; sometimes, their vide is outdated. That is why it is essential to have a place where each quest guide is up-to-date.
<p>
At the start of the project, the goal of our team is to develop a website that could provide most of the features that I have mentioned above. That is why we would need abode XD, photoshop, Atoms, Visual Code Studio, Django, etc. Also about the hardware, I believe that school computers are working fine.
</p>
<p>
Some of the skills that may be needed for this project are that the members have to interest in games and the game title itself in others do a lot of research. Also, each member has to interest in learning new things since the required for the projects would be hard, forcing each member to learn different themselves.
If this project comes out to be successful, we could gain a passive income from ads. Furthermore, we could co-operate with the game developer to further develop the application. The problems of most new players can not understand would be fixed since it is easier to understand the game. This project could help many newbie players stick with the game longer, especially the community of the games outgrow.
